## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed and running:

  * **Docker:** Must be running on your system.
  * **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installed.
  * **VS Code Extension:** The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code.

## 🏁 Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to get your environment up and running in minutes.

### 1\. Create Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and create a new folder for your project.

```bash
mkdir polkavm-devcontainer
cd polkavm-devcontainer
```

### 2\. Install the DevContainer Configuration

Run the following script to fetch and set up the DevContainer files in your project.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/smart-contracts-devcontainer/main/.devcontainer/fetch-devcontainer.sh | bash -s --
```

### 3\. Reopen in Container

Now, open the project folder in VS Code.

> **💡 Important:**
> VS Code will automatically detect the `.devcontainer` folder and prompt you in the bottom-right corner. Click **"Reopen in Container"** to launch the development environment.

After the DevContainer finishes loading, a new terminal will appear, prompting you to choose and install either a Hardhat or Foundry starter project.

## 🛠️ Using the Environment (Hardhat Example)

Let's walk through setting up a Hardhat project. The process is fully automated.

### 1\. Initialize the Hardhat Project

Follow the prompts in the VS Code terminal. The DevContainer will automatically:

  * Create an `npm` project.
  * Install `@parity/hardhat-polkadot` and the correct `solc` version.
  * Install the `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`.
  * Download the necessary `dev-node` and `eth-rpc` binaries.
  * Prompt you to import or generate a private key for deployment.

### 2\. Run Common Commands

You can now use the built-in VS Code terminal to manage your project.

#### Compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

*You'll see a success message once the Solidity files are compiled.*

```
vscode ➜ /project $ npx hardhat compile
Downloading compiler 0.8.28
Downloading latest version of the resolc compiler
Compiling 12 Solidity files
Generating typings for: 14 artifacts in dir: typechain-types for target: ethers-v6
Successfully generated 52 typings!
Successfully compiled 12 Solidity files
```

#### Run the test suite:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

*The output will show a list of passing tests, confirming your setup is working correctly.*

```
vscode ➜ /project $ npx hardhat test


  MyToken
    ✔ assigns initial supply to deployer
    ✔ allows minting by MINTER_ROLE (174ms)
    ✔ rejects minting by non-minters (51ms)
    ✔ allows burning (177ms)
    ✔ pauses transfers (221ms)
    ✔ rejects pause by non-pauser (42ms)
    ✔ unpauses transfers (545ms)
    ✔ assigns roles correctly


  8 passing (4s)
```

### 3\. Deploy to Your Local Node

The DevContainer includes a local PolkaVM node for instant testing.

#### Start the local node:

Open a **new** VS Code terminal (`Terminal > New Terminal`) and run:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

#### Deploy your contract:

Open a **third** terminal and run the deployment script.

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.ts --network localNode
```

After confirming, you'll see a success message with your newly deployed contract address:

```
✔ Confirm deploy to network localNode (420420420)? … yes

```

## 🎉 Conclusion: Your PolkaVM Launchpad

Congratulations\! This DevContainer is your launchpad for building on PolkaVM.

  * ✅ **No More Setup:** It removes complex configuration.
  * ✅ **All-in-One:** Bundles a local node, RPC tools, and Hardhat/Foundry.
  * ✅ **Build Faster:** Go directly from idea to deployment.
