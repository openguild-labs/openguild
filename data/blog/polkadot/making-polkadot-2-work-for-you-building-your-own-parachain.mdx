Polkadot 2.0 is on the horizon. With a big new update, comes big and exciting new features, right?

While developers have multiple paths to choose from in this new ecosystem, the most exciting opportunity lies in Polkadot’s Parachains. More specifically, in building your own custom blockchain that plugs directly into Polkadot's shared security model.

## Polkadot 2.0’s Secret Sauce

There are three main things that make up Polkadot 2.0’s biggest improvements. We’ll touch briefly on those in this blog post.

### Step on the gas pedal with Async Backing

Blockchains are usually defined by two fundamental limits - block storage and block time. This is why Bitcoin feels archaic 16 years after its inception. 10 minutes is far too long to wait for a block in today’s fast-moving world of web3.

Async Backing turns up the speed on Polkadot by enabling parallel transaction validation on Polkadot, breaking free of single-threaded processing that bogs down many older chains. It also reduces the block time by hald, from 12 seconds down to 6 seconds while increasing the block size by up to four times, so more data can be processed more quickly.

### Stop paying extra with Agile Coretime

Paying for what you use should be the way things should be - but typically that’s not always the case. Projects often pay for resources that sit idle or are inefficiently put to use. With Polkadot 2.0’s Agile Coretime, you can now pay for blockspace resources, or “Coretime” in bulk - or if you want to make the most of the market, trade Coretime options on a secondary market. You can also purchase Coretime in smaller amounts, if bulk purchasing isn’t for you. No one gets locked out.

### Plan to Grow with Elastic Scaling

With the powers of Async Backing and Agile Coretime combined, the workload of having to re-evaluate and recalculate resources sounds like a pain in itself - but it doesn’t have to be.

As Polkadot 2.0 rolls out, Elastic Scaling will arrive as a tool for dynamic scalability to help projects manage computing needs as they change in size. One way of doing this is for projects to be able to lease additional Cores if needed to supplement spikes in demand or unexpected growth - so now you can be prepared for those moments when you once said you’d cross that bridge when you come to it.

## Why Build Your Own Parachain?

This might sound counterintuitive at first - we’re already used to hearing about new Ethereum Layer-2 chains being spun up every other day. Why create a new chain?

![Do more, pay less](/static/images/polkadot/blog/graphics/l2-vs-parachain.png)

Unlike launching yet another L2 that relies on external infrastructure and trust assumptions, creating a parachain gives you something unprecedented: a fully customizable blockchain that inherits the security of Polkadot's validator network from day one.

When your project scales to the point where it would need a more fine-tuned infrastructure in order to scale further and perform more efficiently, building a Parachain can help you build a chain that fits your project - not the other way around.

This isn't just about spinning up another chain. When you build a parachain, you're creating infrastructure that fits your project's exact needs rather than forcing your project to conform to existing limitations. Need custom transaction types? Specific consensus mechanisms? Novel governance structures? A parachain lets you build exactly what your application requires.

The best part? You get all of this while still being able to enjoy the benefits of integrating with the Polkadot ecosystem and Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM without the need for external resources and infrastructure.

## The Parachain Advantage: Native Cross-Chain Integration

Here's where parachain creation truly shines. Your custom chain doesn't exist in isolation - it becomes a first-class citizen in the Polkadot ecosystem with native Cross-Chain Messaging (XCM) capabilities.

Polkadot's XCM isn't like the cross-chain bridges you know today. When you build a parachain, you get parachain-to-parachain messaging that leverages the existing native validator set without any trust assumptions beyond that of the parachains themselves. No external validators, third-party oracles, or centralized relayers - just direct, trust-minimized communication between your chain and the entire Polkadot ecosystem.

## When Parachain Creation Makes Sense

Building a parachain is a significant undertaking, but it becomes the optimal choice when:

- Your project has scaled beyond what existing chains can efficiently support
- You need custom runtime logic that isn't possible with smart contracts
- Your application requires specific transaction types or consensus mechanisms
- You want to optimize for particular performance characteristics
- Your project needs deep integration with multiple other chains in the ecosystem

This path may sound daunting, but when your project demands infrastructure that can grow with your vision rather than constrain it, parachain development offers unparalleled flexibility.

Luckily, Polkadot 2.0 isn’t just going to throw documentation at the world and let the “cloud” prepare solutions.

## Meet the Polkadot Deployment Portal

Launching your own Parachain is not a new part of Polkadot, it is something you can even do today by taking a deep dive into the Polkadot documentation and learning the ropes.

However for those who want to focus on building projects instead of being caught up in infrastructure, the Polkadot Deployment Portal is your new friend. Think of it as a Parachain-as-a-Service. A way to spin up parachains quickly and easily.

The Polkadot Deployment Portal has a familiar interface especially if you have tried Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers in the past. You get full control over your Parachain, from its coretime, execution environment and 

## Alternative Paths in the Polkadot 2.0 Ecosystem

Of course, not every project needs its own parachain. Polkadot 2.0 offers other development paths:

For Solidity Developers: The Polkadot Hub provides an EVM-compatible environment with XCM superpowers, letting you stay in your comfort zone while accessing the broader ecosystem.

For Performance-Focused Developers: ink! smart contracts offer native WebAssembly execution on Polkadot's RISC-V architecture, providing better performance and gas efficiency than EVM translations.

But when these options aren't enough - when your project needs the ultimate in customization and performance - parachain creation becomes your gateway to building the blockchain infrastructure of tomorrow.

## Start Experimenting Today

You don't have to wait to explore parachain development. The Westend Asset Hub Testnet is already live, giving you a playground to experiment with Polkadot's infrastructure and understand how parachain integration works.

Whether you're planning to build the next generation of DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, or entirely new categories of blockchain applications, parachain creation on Polkadot 2.0 offers the tools to build infrastructure that scales with your ambitions.
