summary: 'Polkadot Hub is introducing a dual-VM architecture to get the best of both worlds. It uses REVM to provide immediate, 100% EVM compatibility for existing Solidity apps, and PolkaVM (a next-gen RISC-V engine) for superior performance and low-cost execution.'

## 1\. What is Polkadot Hub?

**Polkadot Hub** is a **Layer 1 system chain** within the Polkadot Cloud ecosystem that enables **smart contract deployment** and execution. It serves as the central hub for asset management, cross-chain communication, and decentralized finance applications. It combines **Ethereum compatibility** with native Polkadot innovations to create a unified platform for building scalable, interoperable DeFi applications.

## 2\. The Multi-VM Trend

Given the current demand for computationally intensive applications—such as those involving privacy, ZK, and AI—and the trend towards developing diverse use cases, **multi-VM support** on a blockchain has become a necessity.

Here are some typical examples:

### \#\#\# Polkadot Hub

  * It features a dual-VM architecture with two virtual machines: a **`PolkaVM` (RISC-V)** for native Polkadot logic and an **`REVM`** for Ethereum compatibility.
  * This dual-VM approach allows developers to deploy smart contracts using either Polkadot's native environment or Solidity, enhancing scalability, interoperability, and performance.

### \#\#\# Arbitrum

  * Arbitrum’s **Stylus** upgrade introduced a multi-VM environment, running the standard **EVM** alongside a **WASM VM**.
  * This gives developers language flexibility (Rust, C++) and leverages WASM's strengths for high-performance logic, advanced DeFi, and on-chain gaming.

### \#\#\# Avalanche

  * Supports three primary VMs: **Coreth (C-Chain)** which is EVM-compatible, **Platform VM (P-Chain)** for staking and L1 operations, and **Avalanche VM (X-Chain)** for native token operations.
  * Developers can also create custom VMs using any programming language with familiar tools.

## 3\. The Two Virtual Machines on Polkadot Hub

### \#\#\# 3.1 PolkaVM

`PolkaVM` is Polkadot's modern, next-generation execution environment built on the **RISC-V** architecture.

  * **Faster execution:** Designed to be orders of magnitude faster than traditional EVM environments.
  * **Lower costs:** Contracts run cheaper due to more efficient resource usage.
  * **Better performance:** Uses a register-based design (like modern computer chips) instead of older stack-based systems.
  * **Future-proof:** Optimized for advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs.

### \#\#\# 3.2 EVM/REVM

The second environment is EVM compatibility, delivered through `REVM`. Think of this as a bridge to the existing Ethereum ecosystem.

  * **Existing apps work unchanged:** Developers can deploy unmodified Solidity contracts directly to Polkadot Hub.
  * **No rewriting needed:** Developers don't need to change their code or tools—everything they know from Ethereum works the same way.
  * **Rapid adoption:** Existing Ethereum projects can migrate with minimal effort.

### \#\#\# 3.3 PolkaVM vs. REVM: Quick Comparison

| Aspect | PolkaVM | REVM (EVM-Compatible) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Tech** | RISC-V (hardware-efficient) | Rust-based EVM interpreter |
| **Speed/Cost** | 2-5x faster, lower gas | Matches Ethereum, higher overhead |
| **Languages** | `ink!` (Rust) + Solidity | Solidity only |
| **Use Case** | Native Polkadot apps, ZK-heavy | Ethereum dApp ports |
| **Maturity** | Live on testnet (2025 rollout) | Production-ready now |

## 4\. Dual-VM Architecture Overview

`pallet-revive` is an experimental smart contract pallet that executes contracts using two virtual machines:

  * **High-Performance Mode:** Native RISC-V 64-bit execution engine using `PolkaVM`.
  * **Compatibility Mode:** Ethereum bytecode compatibility layer using `REVM`.

### \#\#\# The On/Off Switch

The `AllowEVMBytecode` setting is simply the switch that tells the system which mode to use:

  * **Switch = ON (`true`):** The system runs in **Compatibility Mode** to welcome dApps from EVM-compatible chains.
  * **Switch = OFF (`false`):** The system runs in **High-Performance Mode** to use Polkadot's own advanced engine.

## 5\. Why This Dual Approach?

The strategy is pragmatic: **quick adoption now, innovation later.**

  * **Short-term (REVM first):** By offering full Ethereum compatibility through `REVM`, Polkadot Hub can immediately attract existing Ethereum applications, users, and liquidity. This gets the ecosystem growing fast.
  * **Long-term (PolkaVM focused):** Once the ecosystem has momentum, developers can gradually migrate to `PolkaVM` to benefit from the superior performance and lower costs.
  * **Developer choice:** Developers aren't forced into one path. Early apps might use EVM for simplicity, then switch to `PolkaVM` as they mature.

## 6\. The Practical Benefits

For users and developers, the dual-VM architecture means:

  * **Easy migration:** Ethereum projects can move to Polkadot Hub almost instantly through `REVM`.
  * **Better performance:** Over time, apps can upgrade to `PolkaVM` for faster, cheaper execution.
  * **Growing ecosystem:** More applications create more network effects, attracting more users and builders.
  * **Security:** All applications get Polkadot's robust, shared security system regardless of which VM they use.

## 7\. Conclusion

This architecture represents Polkadot's balanced approach: bringing both immediate market adoption and long-term technical innovation to enable complex applications while maintaining the developer experience everyone already knows.
